I am no longer interested in this project. I can try to fix this if it is broken, but I will probably not add new features.

# PdfHandoutCrop
A tool to crop pdf handout with multiple pages per sheet

PdfHandoutCrop is a tool to crop pdf handout with multiple pages per sheet. Sometimes the teacher give us handout in pdf format with multiple pages per sheet. If I print it directly, the font size and pictures are too small to read. So I created PdfHandoutCrop to help me crop the handout.

# Issues
If the PDF file is not cropped correctly or content in  output file is different from original file, there is a bug in PdfHandoutCrop. Please [report an issue](https://github.com/cges30901/pdfhandoutcrop/issues).

# Download
You can download from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pdfhandoutcrop/)
